A custom __Rust__ game development framework using [ggez][ggez].

This is a game development framework, specifically designed for my personal use.  
I don't think other developers will find _any_ value using this.

This project was created in anticipation of the __43<sup>rd</sup>__ [__Ludum Dare__][ludumdare] game jam event.
